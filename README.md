# IoT Ambience project
### This project was created during my internship at Execom in my freshman year (October 2020).  
### It was primarily oriented as a IoT/Embedded and Cloud learning opportunity.

## Project structure
### The project was intended to work on three types of hardware that require constant mutual communication through various communication protocols, as well as with a cloud platform.  
### The structure of how they fit together was described below:
